** setup
*** installation
**** database
     only tested with postgres (limitation is what diesel supports)
     - install postgres
     - add user
     - create database
**** diesel
***** varient 1 (recomended I guess?)
     #+begin_src sh
       $ cargo install diesel_cli
       $ export DATABASE_URL="postgres://fbot:pass@localhost/fbot
       $ diesel setup
     #+end_src
***** varient 2 (untested)
     run every =up.sql= from =migrations/=
*** configure bot
    edit `fbot.dhall`
    
    (chat credentials can stay unset for interactive mode)
*** build
    #+begin_src sh 
      $ cargo build
    #+end_src
*** run in interactive mode
    #+begin_src 
    $ cargo run -- i
    #+end_src
    have fun ;-)
** hack it
** bots
   bots are located in `bots`

   when changed =migrations/= rerun them with =diesel migration redo= (possibly needed: =run=/=revert=)
*** new bots
    new bots have to be registered in `main.rs` (or they aren't processed)
    
    templates can be found in `src/bots/mod.rs`. you probably want to use `simple_bot` or `clap_bot` (for splitted arguments) 
    
    don't forget to include an entry in `fbot.dhall`
